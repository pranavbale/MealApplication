React Meal Application for ordering a food 


The React Meal Application is a web-based platform that I created using React. Its primary purpose is to provide users with an interface to browse and order food products. The application consists of two main components: the food product listing and the cart.

1. Food Product Listing:

The food product listing is a section where users can view various food items available for purchase. Each food product is displayed with its name, description, and price.

2. Cart:

The cart is another crucial part of the application. It is a container that holds the food items selected by the user for purchase. When a user clicks the "Add" button on a food product, the item is added to the cart. Users can view the contents of their cart at any time, which typically displays a list of the food products they have selected and their total prices.

3. Adding and Removing Items:

To allow users to add and remove items from the cart, you may have implemented functionalities like increase or decrease quantity buttons for each item in the cart. Users can adjust the quantity or remove items completely from the cart as needed.


Overall, the React Meal Application offers users a seamless and intuitive way to explore and select food products. By utilizing React's component-based architecture and state management, you have created a dynamic and interactive user interface that enhances the overall user experience.
